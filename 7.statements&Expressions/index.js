//Statements are instructions in JavaScript that have to be executed by a web browser. 
//JavaScript code is made up of a sequence of statements and is executed 
//in the same order as they are written.

//A Variable declaration is the simplest example of a JavaScript statement.

//Example
var firstName = "Newton" ; 

//Other types of JavaScript statements include conditions/decision making, loops, etc.

//White (blank) spaces in statements are ignored.

//It is optional to end each JavaScript statement with a semicolon. 
//But it is highly recommended to use it as it avoids possible misinterpretation 
//of the end of the statements by JavaScript engine.

//While writing client-logic in JavaScript, variables and operators are often combined to do computations. 
//This is achieved by writing expressions.
