do-while loop: 
This loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code inside
 the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
  This is useful in situations where you want the code to run at least once and
   then check the condition for further iterations.

5. Robotics and Automation:
In manufacturing processes, robots or automated systems may use loops to repeat
certain tasks until a condition is met. For example, a robot arm might use a 
`do-while` loop to continue picking and placing items until the production line is empty.
