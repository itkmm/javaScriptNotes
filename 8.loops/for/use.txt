for loop: 
This loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance and want 
a concise way to express the initialization, condition, and iteration step.

1. Traffic Signals:
A traffic light system might use loops to control the timing of the signal lights. 
For example, a `for` loop could be used to cycle through the different lights
 (red, yellow, green) in a predetermined sequence.

2.Elevator Systems:
 Elevator systems in buildings might use loops to control the movement of the
  elevator car between floors. A `for` loop could be employed to iterate 
  through the floors in a sequence, stopping at each floor where passengers are waiting.
