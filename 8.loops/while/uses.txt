while loop: 
This loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true.
 It is more flexible than the for loop when the number of iterations is not known 
 beforehand.

1. Washing Machines:
   - In a washing machine, loops could be used to control the cycles of washing, 
   rinsing, and spinning. A `while` loop might be used to continuously agitate 
   the clothes until a certain condition 
   (e.g., a set time or completion of the wash cycle) is met.

2. Temperature Control:
   - Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems often use loops
    to control the temperature. A `while` loop might be used to continually adjust 
    the heating or cooling until the desired temperature is reached.
