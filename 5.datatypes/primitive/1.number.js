//Literals
//A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. 


//In JavaScript, any other value that does not belong to the above-mentioned types is not considered 
//as a legal number. Such values are represented as NaN (Not-a-Number). 

let result = 0/0; // its value is NaN  
let Result = "Ten" * 5; //its value is NaN 
console.log(result);
