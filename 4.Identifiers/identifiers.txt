To model the real-world entities,they have to be named to use it in the JavaScript program.
Identifiers are those names that help in naming the elements in JavaScript.
Example:
firstName;
placeOfVisit;

Identifiers should follow below rules:
The first character of an identifier should be letters of the alphabet or an underscore (_) or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters can be letters of alphabets or digits or underscores (_) or a dollar sign ($).
Identifiers are case-sensitive. Hence, firstName and FirstName are not the same.
Reserved keywords are part of programming language syntax and cannot be used as identifiers.
