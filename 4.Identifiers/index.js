//To be able to proceed with the manipulation of the data assigned to the variables,
//it is mandatory for a programming language to know the type of value or
//the type of data that the variable holds.
//That is because the operations or manipulations 
//that must be applied on a variable will be specific to the type of data that a variable will hold.
